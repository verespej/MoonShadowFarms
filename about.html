		<h2>About Moon Shadow Ranch</h2>
		Moon Shadow Ranch (MSR) is a small, family-owned and operated farm 
		nestled in the foot-hills of Rainbow, California.<br />
		<br />
		Our dream is to become a full, self-sustaining farming operation
		and to bring our customers and friends the the best in fresh, healthy, 
		organic products, all grown right here on the ranch. We also hope to 
		some day invite you and your family to join us on a weekend getaway. 
		Guests will be able to explore the native landscapes, visit nearby 
		wineries, casinos, and golf courses or just play on the farm. We have 
		a budding herd of beautiful Arabian and Peruvian Paso riding horses, 
		a troupe of friendly goats, and abounding wildlife. For those new to 
		Southern California, visiting some of San Diego's world-renowned 
		attractions is a must, but you'll want to make sure you're home in time 
		to enjoy the delicious, wholesome cuisines we serve!<br />
		<br />
		At present, our focus is on pushing towards marketable quantities of 
		produce. Of course, this will take time since it is of highest priority 
		to ensure the quality of everything we offer. To date, our biggest 
		crop is fertilizer, courtesy of the numerous animals we have. But 
		seriously, we are generating fair quantities of eggs and an assortment of 
		fruits and vegetables. We also have a few lovely horses for sale and 
		once we have our commercial dairy license, we will be able to offer milk, 
		cheese, and numerous other dairy products.<br />
		<br />
		In the very near future, Moon Shadow Farms will be certified organic 
		meaning we can guarantee new customers the purity of the natural produce 
		our friends and family already enjoy. Fall 2005, we are expecting a small 
		but marketably-sized crop of pomegranates which is very exciting 
		considering the recent affection people have developed for the healthful 
		and nutritious fruit. Peas and blackberries are also in the ground, but 
		not in sufficient quantities to bring to market.<br />
