		<h2>Umbra Luna Lamanchas</h2>
		A couple of years after Moon Shadow Ranch began to materialize 
		as a real farm, we began thinking about how we could broaden the 
		selection we offer our customers. Dairy was the immediate answer. 
		What was not so clear at the time was how to bring something as unique 
		and as memorable as our farm to the table. While travelling down this 
		path we had the very good fortune of coming across dairy goats. Umbra 
		Luna Lamanchas was soon to become an important part of Moon Shadow Ranch.<br />
		<br />
		The particular breed of dairy goat we chose is the Lamancha. There are 
		a number of defining characteristics that led us to favor the Lamanchas. 
		Following our goals, one of the primary reasons for the decision was the 
		wonderfully rich and mild-flavored milk they produce. Unlike the milk 
		produced by many other breeds of dairy goat, Lamancha milk doesn't taste 
		like goat. Additionally, the goats do very well in the biome our land 
		is located in. The natural foliage of our land supplies them with a healthy 
		portion of their nutritional intake. Aside from all of that, it is important 
		to us that all of the animals on our farm are people-friendly. Lamanchas 
		fit this role quite well. They are intelligent and outgoing with entertaining 
		personalities.<br />
		<br />
		If you are familiar with the size of goats, it is certainly reasonable to 
		ask "what can you expect one little goat to produce?" One of our 
		prize-winning, grand-champion Lamancha dairy goats answers that question 
		daily with two whole gallons of milk. That's right. Two <i>gallons</i> 
		of milk per day, per goat.<br />
		<br />
		It would be easy to take all this milk to the market and sell it just for 
		drinking. It is our belief, however, that through ingenuity and novel 
		innovation we can provide our family, friends, and customers with wonderful 
		products that they simply can not find elsewhere. One of our most exciting 
		projects at the moment is the use of goats milk in skin care products. The 
		nutrional value of our Lamanchas' milk is not limited to dietary enhancement. 
		It is well known that goats milk is excellent for use in skin care. While 
		this is not the most original of the ideas we are pursuing, we are proud to 
		be able to offer these goods with original scents created using much of the 
		same natural growth from our land that our goats love to eat. We are also 
		pursuing goat-breeding interests. We are currently attempting to cross the 
		Lamancha with smaller goats to acheive a small, family-sized goat that will 
		inheret the Lamanchas' quality of milk. This would result in a goat that 
		could be easily cared for as a family pet, while producing about a quart of 
		market-quality milk per day.<br />
