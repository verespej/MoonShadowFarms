		<h2>Ezis Arabians</h2>
		A much loved part of our farm is Ezis Arabians, a small Arabian horse 
		breeding operation. Ezis Arabians started with the gorgeous and gentle 
		<i>Stella Luna VS</i> (<i>Baskemo</i> x <i>Eters Windsong</i>). This 
		tall mare brought with her the undeniable beauty and breathtaking motion 
		that she has passed on to her progeny. Our attention soon turned towards 
		complimenting Stella's refinement with the bone density and mass 
		necessary for endurance purposes.<br />
		<br />
		After much research, we finally found the right breeding partner: 
		Al-Marah Arabians. With Al-Marah's focus on reigning and cutting, we 
		found their breeding objectives to meet our needs. Numerous discussions 
		ensued along with several trips to Tucson, Arizona. It was there that 
		we found <i>Al-Marah Garcon</i> (<i>Canadian Beau</i> x 
		<i>AM Tis Beverlie</i>). A year passed and Stella blessed us with his 
		baby, a filly whose blood carries generations of motion that most people 
		equate to floating on air. With her mother's beauty and disposition, 
		<i>MS Claire De Lune</i> will capture your heart before a moment's notice.<br />
		<br />
		A little bonus resulting from our relationship with Al-Marah was the 
		discovery of an excellent brood mare that embodied what we sought. This 
		horse, <i>AM Shara Joke</i> (<i>Deep Freeze</i> x <i>Finale Seranade</i>), 
		soon joined us at Moon Shadow Ranch and foaled <i>MS Debussy</i> 
		(<i>Seagfreed</i> + x <i>AM Shara Joke</i>), who was an outstandingly 
		solid colt and has become a strong, sound, and handsome stallion. Much 
		to our pleasure, his temperament is actually milder than many geldings 
		and he is an absolute joy to work with.<br />
		<br />
		The most recent additions to the herd include Debussy's brother, 
		<i>MS Shara Dream</i> by <i>AM Power Raid</i>, and sister, 
		<i>MS Shara Toy</i> by <i>IMA Tonka Toy</i>. We also had tremendous 
		success with our first in-house breeding resulting in a delightful colt 
		named <i>MS Debussy's Prelude</i> (<i>MS Debussy</i> x 
		<i>Stella Luna VS</i>), who vibrantly bears his mother's grace and his 
		father's sturdy legs.<br />
		<br />
		<h2>Are you looking to buy or lease a horse?</h2>
		We may have just what you've been searching for. We are very excited 
		to offer our unique mare leasing program. We have several mares 
		available to lease for breeding purposes. If you have a stallion in 
		mind, but need the right dam, <a href='contact.html'>contact us</a>.<br />
		<br />
		In addition to our mares, we have two excellent stallions for stud, MS Debussy and MS Shara Dream.<br />
